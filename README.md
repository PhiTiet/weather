A small personal project to demonstrate my Kotlin ability:

What it does:
- Communicates with Open-Meteo for weather information
- Updates 'recipients' with a daily update when the weather is pleasant enough to swim in.

Improvements:

- Show MockK ability
- Show more syntactical ability: Trailing lambda & infix
- Finish system mocking (Ideally I'd use a vault but I think that is overkill for the sake of a demonstration)
